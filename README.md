# MongoDB Coursework

Open the pdf to read about the project.

Open setup.js and copy and paste the document into a mongodb terminal window.

Then run any of the queries inside queries.js inside a mongodb terminal that has had the setup.js file ran.

Use the insertsProgramatically.js file if you want to insert more drivers or bookings into the project.

Use generateDailyReportsTrigger.js onto the atlas cluster in the triggers section and apply it as a schedule 
trigger every 24 hours or every minute for testing, make sure the values inside the file match 
the database/collection names.

Use textDriverUpdateTrigger.js with the atlas cluster in the triggers section as a database trigger, 
with the twilio extension installed and setup, no further help 
on this is given, in theory it should work.

See the database folder for a copy of a local database with setup.js ran into it
